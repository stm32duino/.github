## :sparkles: How you can contribute

**Any contribution are welcome and very appreciated.**

* __Triage__ open issues: try to reproduce issues reported by other users and confirm whether you can experience them as well, or ask users for more details if needed. Spot duplicates. Improve descriptions. Help users who ask for support.
* __Submit__ fixes and implementations: pick an open issue or feature request that you think you can implement yourself, and submit a pull request following the [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
* __Review__ and comment on the changes proposed in open pull requests suggesting good ways to implement fixes and features.
* __Test__ open pull requests: try to run the proposed modifications and report your success or failure. Testing on real hardware takes time and any help in this will speed up our responsiveness in merging contributions.
* __Help others__ by answering to GitHub [discussions] or topics in the dedicated [stm32duino forum]
* __Write documentation__ and improve the existing content. Including the [WiKi]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are looking for new contributor/maintainer to help on above topics. If you are interested to join the stm32duino team to contribute to one or more repositories,
